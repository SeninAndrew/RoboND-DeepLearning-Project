## Follow me Project Overview ##

In this project I implemented a segmentation deep neural network to detect the 'hero' (a lady in the red dress). This network is used to navigate the drone in street evironment. The network performs segmentation of 3 types of objects: background, people, the hero. 

## Data

As training data I was using the images provided by Udacity: [train.zip](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Lab/train.zip),  [validation.zip](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Lab/validation.zip), and [sample_evaluation_data.zip](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Deep+Learning+Data/Project/sample_evaluation_data.zip).
